                You support Manchester United. I support Man City. <br>
                This is our derby, a clash of passion, loyalty, and endless debates. But no matter who wins on the pitch, you’ll always have the last goal in my heart.

                If we were on opposite teams, I’d still pass the ball to you every time. If life was a penalty shootout, I’d let you take the winning shot. Every moment with you is a match worth playing.

               Happy Valentine's Day, Nelly! Some rivalries never end, but this one is my favorite. 😉⚽
